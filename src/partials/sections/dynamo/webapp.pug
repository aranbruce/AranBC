                h5 A Web Application that Delivered a Seamless Mortgage Journey
                p Dynamo’s ambition was to build a customer-facing digital fact find that trasitioned 
                    | smoothly into an advice call with a mortgage expert. Information submitted by 
                    | the customer would then be used to brief mortgage experts on a customer’s 
                    | circumstances, helping them tailor the advice they gave.

                p To deliver on this, Dynamo created a web application on the MERN stack (MongoDB, 
                    | Express.js, React, Node.js), using a combination of co-located and near-shore 
                    | developers.

                p Together, we created a customer journey that was intuitive for our customers, with 
                    | the ability for someone to track their application through to completion. It 
                    | also synchronised instantly with our bespoke CRM system, allowing our customer 
                    | support to instantly understand where someone was in their application.
